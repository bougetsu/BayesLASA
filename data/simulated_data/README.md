## Simulated polygon dataset

This folder contains the simulated data for testing BayesLASA, as demonstrated in the manuscript "Bayesian Landmark-based Shape Analysis of Tumor Pathology Images".

Simulated data of 1,504 polygonal chains generated by `sim_generating.R` are provided in .Rdata format. For instance, the file name `Normal_4_equil_FALSE_pn_100_seed_1.Rdata` indicates that the polygonal chain was generated with 4 landmark points, NOT equilateral, has 100 points in total, and a random seed of 1 using the simulation generation function `sim_randon_polygon_generator`, which is provided in `code/landmark_detection/sim_polygon_gaussian.R`.

The .Rdata file stores an R List item called `polygon`, which consists of:

* `polyg$original_data`: The generated polygonal chain, comprising four columns: `x` and `y` indicate the corresponding coordinates, `gamma` indicates whether the point is a landmark point, and `sigma` is the sigma parameter used to generate the segment.

* `polyg$normalized`: Normalized polygonal chain with unit length.

* `polyg$smooth001`: Normalized polygonal chain with unit length after kernel smoothing.
