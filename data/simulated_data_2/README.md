The 1500 simulated datasets are stored in two folders: simulated_data and simulated_data_2. The filename reveals the following information:
1. Normal: The deviation between the observed polygonal chain and the landmark polygonal chain is i.i.d. sampled from a normal distribution;
2. The numbers 4, 5, and 6 correspond to a quadrilateral, pentagonal, and hexagonal landmark polygonal chains;
3. equil_TRUE or equal_FALSE indicates if the landmark polygonal chains edges are with the same length or not;
4. pn_100, 150, 200, 300, and 500 indicate the number of vertices in the observed polygonal chain;
5. seed_number indices the replicates.
